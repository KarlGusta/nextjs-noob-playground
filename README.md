## 🚀 Wait — Are You Here by Accident?

If someone shared this repo with you, you just stumbled onto something good.

This playground is one small piece of **Zero to SaaS** — a course designed for people who want to build real software products, not just follow along with tutorials they'll forget in a week.

**Here's what makes it different:**
- You build real things, from day one
- No fluff — every lesson moves you closer to a live, working product
- A community of builders going through it with you
- By the end, you have a SaaS you can show (or sell)

## Next.js Noob Playground

Welcome! This repo contains 7 small Next.js apps to help you learn by doing.

## What is this?

Each numbered folder is a **complete, working Next.js app**. You can run any folder independently, break things, fix them, and learn without fear.

## How to use this repo

1. Pick any folder (start with `01-hello-next`)
2. Open your terminal and navigate into that folder:
```bash
cd 01-hello-next
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
6. **Edit the code and see what happens!**

## The Lessons

- **01-hello-next** - Your first Next.js page
- **02-pages-and-routing** - Multiple pages and navigation
- **03-components-and-props** - Reusable components
- **04-state-and-events** - Interactive buttons and state
- **05-data-fetching** - Get data from an API
- **06-basic-styling** - Make things look good
- **07-mini-project** - Build a simple profile page

## Tips for learning

- **Break things on purpose** - Change values, delete lines, see what breaks
- **Read the comments** - Every file has helpful comments
- **One folder at a time** - Don't rush, master each lesson
- **Google errors** - Error messages are your friends

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- A browser

Happy coding! 🎉
