# Next.js Noob Playground 🚀

Welcome! This repo contains 7 small Next.js apps to help you learn by doing.

## What is this?

Each numbered folder is a **complete, working Next.js app**. You can run any folder independently, break things, fix them, and learn without fear.

## How to use this repo

1. Pick any folder (start with `01-hello-next`)
2. Open your terminal and navigate into that folder:
```bash
   cd 01-hello-next
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
```
4. Start the app:
```bash
   npm run dev
```
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
6. **Edit the code and see what happens!**
