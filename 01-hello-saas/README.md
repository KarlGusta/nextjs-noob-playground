# Lesson 01: Hello SaaS

Your first step into building a real SaaS product.

## What you'll learn (Day 1)

- How to run a Next.js app
- The SaaS builder mindset
- Shipping fast vs shipping perfect
- How hot reloading works

## Run it
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Mindset Reminders

**Think like an entrepreneur:**
- Perfect code doesn't matter if nobody uses your product
- Ship fast, get feedback, improve
- Use AI tools when you're stuck (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor)
- Your first version will be ugly - that's normal!

**Staying motivated:**
- Build something YOU would use
- Show progress to friends (even if it's rough)
- Celebrate small wins (like getting this running!)
- Remember: every big SaaS started as a simple page like this

## Try this

1. Change the heading text to your SaaS idea
2. Add a new paragraph about what problem you're solving
3. Change the background colors
4. Add your name as the founder
